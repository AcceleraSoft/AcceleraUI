> A React-based user interface for highly interactive applications

highly interactive applications. The components have been hand-made to be both
flexible and efficient.

**Features**

 - **Advanced components** for high user productivity.
 - **Fast load times** due to a minimal amount of dependencies and the use of CSS modules that can be preloaded
 - **Fully themable** so you can match the interface with the rest of your company theme.
